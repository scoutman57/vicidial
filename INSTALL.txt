INSTALLATION SUMMARY:
Here's my first stab at some installation instructions:

HERE'S SOME SOFTWARE TO INSTALL ON YOUR ASTERISK SERVER:
here's what you need to make sure you have installed on the machine to allow for 
recording to work properly:
sox - http://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/

Here's the asterisk perl AGI module that you need loaded for perl AGI scripts:
asterisk-perl - http://asterisk.gnuinter.net

Here's a great program for starting asterisk in a detached screen that can log 
verbose messages:
screen - http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/

OPTIONAL(but encouraged):
Here's a nice terminal program to graph system load that will help you figure 
out your capacity:

To install my software you need to make sure you:
 - have at least 1 SIP phone and 1 Zaptel channel available on your Asterisk 
server. 
 - have a MySQL database "asterisk" created on a machine somewhere on your 
network that the Asterisk server and any clients you have can connect to. see 
CONF_MySQL.txt file
 - have perl with the Net::MySQL, Net::Telnet and Time::HiRes perl modules 
installed on your Asterisk server
   - you can use cpan to install these quickly (perl -MCPAN -e shell) 
 - have all of your phones entered into the phones table of your asterisk 
database
 - have an entry for your Asterisk server in the server_updater table

Now you can install the astgui client server side scripts and configuration 
entries:

extensions.conf Asterisk server config file

Asterisk server config file

and put it in /var/lib/asterisk/sounds
 - create a GSM formatted audio file named "conf.gsm" that is 30 minutes long 
and put it in /var/lib/asterisk/sounds
   - I cannot include the audio files I use for copyright reasons(someone send 
me a royalty-free one to include)
