HERE'S SOME SOFTWARE TO INSTALL ON YOUR ASTERISK SERVER:
here's what you need to make sure you have installed on the machine to allow for 
recording to work properly:
sox - http://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/

Here's the asterisk perl AGI module that you need loaded for perl AGI scripts:
asterisk-perl - http://asterisk.gnuinter.net

Here's a great program for starting asterisk in a detached screen that can log 
verbose messages:
screen - http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/

OPTIONAL(but encouraged):
Here's a nice terminal program to graph system load that will help you figure 
out your capacity:
http://www.daveltd.com/src/util/ttyload/


To install my software you need to make sure you:
 - have at least 1 SIP phone and 1 Zaptel channel available on your Asterisk server. 
 - have a MySQL database "asterisk" created on a machine somewhere on your network 
   that the Asterisk server and any clients you have can connect to. see 
   MySQL_AST_CREATE_tables.sql file
 - have perl with the Net::MySQL, Net::Telnet and Time::HiRes perl modules installed
   on your Asterisk server
   - you can use cpan to install these quickly (perl -MCPAN -e shell) 
 - have all of your phones entered into the phones table of your asterisk database
 - have an entry for your Asterisk server in the server_updater table

Now you can install the astGUIclient server side scripts and configuration entries:
 - add the extensions listed in the CONF_Asterisk.txt file to your extensions.conf 
 Asterisk server config file
 - add the meetme rooms listed in the CONF_Asterisk.txt file to your meetme.conf 
 Asterisk server config file
 - create a GSM formatted audio file named "park.gsm" that is 30 minutes long and 
 put it in /var/lib/asterisk/sounds
 - create a GSM formatted audio file named "conf.gsm" that is 30 minutes long and 
 put it in /var/lib/asterisk/sounds
   - I cannot include the audio files I use for copyright reasons(someone send me 
   a royalty-free one to include)
		- there is one more file you need that's not included with the download 
		package, it's the conf.gsm file(this is the half-hour music file that we use 
		to put people on hold). I have a free classical music file that is available 
		free for download at the following two sites:
			http://www.freedomphones.net/conf.gsm
			http://astguiclient.sf.net/conf.gsm
	   Once you have downloaded it, you will need to copy it to this folder:
			/var/lib/asterisk/sounds/
	   Then you will need to execute this command to copy it as the park file
	   cp /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/conf.gsm /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/park.gsm

 - add an entry for each of the conferences listed in the CONF_Asterisk.txt file to
   the conferences MySQL table
 - add the user "cron" to your system
 - copy the following files to your /home/cron/ directory and chmod them to 0755:
	 - ADMIN_keepalive_AST_update.pl - checks to see that updater is running
	 - ADMIN_keepalive_AST_VDautodial.pl - checks to see that VDAD is running
	 - ADMIN_keepalive_AST_send_listen.pl - checks to see that ACQS is running
	 - ADMIN_restart_roll_logs.pl - rolls logs over datestamp upon restart
	 - AST_CRON_mix_recordings.pl - command line recording mixer to be put in cron
	   - you will want to modify this script to FTP to the proper place, or if
	     you don't want to FTP them somewhere use AST_CRON_mix_recordings_BASIC.pl
	 - AST_flush_DBqueue.pl - flushes the queue of old manager commands
	 - AST_manager_kill_hung_congested.pl - kills CONGEST Local/ channels
	 - AST_manager_listen.pl - listener for the Asterisk Central Queue System (ACQS)
	 - AST_manager_send.pl - send-spawn for the ACQS
	 - AST_reset_mysql_vars.pl - resets MySQL tables 
	 - AST_send_action_child.pl - blind-send for the ACQS
	 - AST_SERVER_conf.pl - file where you define your variables for the server apps
	   - customize this file for your server specifics
	 - AST_update.pl - DB updater of channels on the Asterisk server
	 - AST_VDauto_dial.pl - script that runs the VICIDIAL autodialer
	 - AST_VDhopper.pl - keeps the leads hopper full for VICIDIAL
	 - AST_vm_update.pl - command line DB voicemail count updater
	 - VICIDIAL_IN_new_leads_file.pl - script to load lead files into VICIDIAL

 - copy the following files to your /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/ directory and chmod them to 0755:
	 - agi-dtmf.agi - AGI/perl program that plays DTMF tines for conferences
	 - agi-VDADtransfer.agi - AGI/perl part of VICIDIAL autodialer
	 - call_log.agi - AGI/perl programm for call logging (OPTIONAL)
	 - call_inbound.agi - AGI/perl programm for CallerID popup info (OPTIONAL)

 - create the following empty directories and chmod 0777:
	 - /home/cron/KILL/
	 - /var/spool/incoming/monitor/DONE
	 - /var/spool/incoming/monitor/ORIG

 - add the following entries to the cron of your Asterisk server:
### recording mixing for Asterisk
1,6,11,16,21,26,31,36,41,46,51,56 * * * * /home/cron/AST_CRON_mix_recordings.pl

### keepalive script for Asterisk updaters
* * * * * /home/cron/ADMIN_keepalive_AST_update.pl

### keepalive script for Asterisk manager queue system
* * * * * /home/cron/ADMIN_keepalive_AST_send_listen.pl

### keepalive script for Asterisk VICIDIAL autodial system

### updater for voicemail
* * * * * /home/cron/AST_vm_update.pl

### flush queue DB table every hour for entries older than 2 hours
11 * * * * /home/cron/AST_flush_DBqueue.pl -q

 - copy the "DTMF_sounds" files to /var/lib/asterisk/sounds



INSTALL CLIENT SOFTWARE:

   - astGUIclient_1.0.3.pl - phone GUI application
   - astVICIDIAL_0.6.pl - DIALER GUI application
   - libs folder and everything in it
- for linux, install perl with Tk::Tcl, Net::MySQL, Net::Telnet and Time::HiRes libraries and copy the following files to /usr/local/perl_TK/ and chmod 0755:
   - astGUIclient_1.0.3.pl - phone GUI application
   - astVICIDIAL_0.6.pl - DIALER GUI application
   - libs folder and everything in it

- customize the AST_VICI_conf.pl configuration file for your client station/phone/server



Start it all up and let me know if it works.
