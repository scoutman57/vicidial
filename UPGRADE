########## UPGRADING FROM 2.0.5 TO 2.2.0 ##########

1. install new files:
	perl ./install.pl
	NOTES: If you have customized any scripts in the bin or agi folders, 
	then make sure you back them up before running the install.pl script. 
	This script will replace existing files in the astguiclient installation.

2. upgrade the MySQL asterisk database:
	mysql
	use asterisk
	\. /path/from/root/extras/upgrade_2.2.0.sql
	quit

3. Added new method for monitoring from the Real-time screen using a phone entry

4. Outbound Survey option for using Cepstral Text-to-speech. Requires Cepstral 
	to be installed and configured with proper licenses in place to use.

	the TTS section of the web administration.

5. Added RANDOM and LAST CALL TIME lead order options to campaigns

6. Changed List Mix to be active by default, depricated the 
	AST_VDhopper_MIXtest.pl script, if you use it change it to the

	/usr/share/astguiclient/ADMIN_audio_store_sync.pl --force-upload --debug
	NOTE: Make sure the web audio store folder exists and is writable

10. Added Active Voicemail Server setting to System Settings. Now the voicemail
	and prompt recording extensions are auto-generated so that they all
	direct to the same server and they should be removed from the 
	extensions.conf file:
	8168, 8167, 85026666666666, 8500, 8501

11. Added auto dial limit setting to System Settings to allow setting of the

22. Added DAHDI channel compatibility and carrier logging for outbound list calls

23. Changed Auto-Detected Busy and Disconnected statuses to AB and ADC to better
	separate them from agent-defined statuses

24. Added option to lock out DROP calls from being called again for a period of 
	time, as a campaign option. This is useful to be able to comply with the
	UK telemarketing regulations that state you may not auto-dial a customer
	back within 72 hours of an abandon.

25. Changed In-Group and Call Menu prompts to allow for multiple audio files per
	prompt by separating them by pipes |. Also, changed the Agent Alert 
	Extention to a Filename in In-Groups

	through a batch process(VICIDIAL_UPDATE_leads_status_file.pl) as well
	as a web-based report to show the stats for these transactions

30. Added the option for a Quick Transfer from the agent screen. This option
	allows the blind transfer of a call to the default transfer group or one
	of the presets with a single button click. Also added a preset populate
	feature to pre-populate the Number to Call field with one of the presets
	for the campaign.

	agent frame to AGENTDIRECT transfers when clicking on the NUMBER TO CALL
	field in the transfer conference frame

34. Added Calls in Queue display to Agent screen, along with click to grab a 
	call from this listing. 

35. Added a Re-Queue Call button to send the current call back to an AGENTDIRECT
	in-group for the agent to take later

36. Added rank and owner to the vicidial_list table. the CLI lead loader has
	a new stdrankowner format to add these fields in lead files. Also, added
	these fields to the web-based lead loader formats and field chooser.
	Related to this, RANK and OWNER are now lead order options in the 
	campaign screen.

37. Added automatic list reset option to List Modification screen. You can enter
	multiple times, and the leads in the list will be reset at those times.

38. Added no-hopper dialing option for MANUAL and INBOUND_MAN campaigns. If This

	only available when the dial method is set to MANUAL or INBOUND_MAN. It 
	is recommended that you do not enable this option if you have a very 
	large lead database, over 100,000 leads. With No Hopper Dialing, the 
	following features do not work: lead recycling, auto-alt-dialing, list 
	mix, list ordering with Xth NEW. If you want to use Owner Only Dialing 
	you must have No Hopper Dialing enabled. Default is N for disabled.

39. Added lead owner option to restrict dialing within a list to the owner of a
	lead only. If This is enabled, the agent will only receive leads that 
	they are within the ownership parameters for. If this is set to USER 
	then the agent must be the user defined in the database as the owner of 
	this lead. If this is set to TERRITORY then the owner of the lead must 
	match the territory listed in the User Modification screen for this 
	agent. If this is set to USER_GROUP then the owner of the lead must 
	match the user group that the agent is a member of. For this feature to 
	work the dial method must be set to MANUAL or INBOUND_MAN and No Hopper 
	Dialing must be enabled. Default is NONE for disabled.

	call_log, vicidial_log, vicidial_closer_log, vicidial_xfer_log and
	vicidial_agent_log

45. Added new Inbound Summary Hourly Report to show stats by in-group and broken
	down per in-group in hourly increments. This report also allows
	filtering of the stats by call time scheme.

	overflow drop in-group stats with the outbound campaign stats.

47. Added longest_wait_time option for Next Agent Call in Campaigns and 
	In-Groups.

	in "state"(INCALL, READY, PAUSED, etc...) instead of being based upon
	the time of the last call they handled.

49. Changed the ViciDial agent screen to not delete session reservations by
	default at agent logout. Instead, the ADMIN_keepalive process will clear
	out unused session reservations once a day at the timeclock reset time 
	as set in system_settings.

50. Changed voicemail config to use phone password as voicemail password instead
	of just the voicemail ID as the password

	option for TTS prompt to be used. You must change any custom values you 
	have set in this field to an audio prompt or it will not function 
	properly. Also added WaitForSilence Options setting to the campaign 
	screen. If you want to use this it must be populated in each campaign.

	You must change 8320 to the following in your extensions.conf:

		exten => 8320,2,Hangup
	# the VD_amd_post.agi script is now depricated

60. Added additional Voicemail configuration through admin.php. Voicemail boxes
	can now be created without being tied to a phone. These voicemail boxes

	This requires some lines to be removed from the extensions.conf file:
	- remove the TRUNKloop and TRUNKblind entries near the top

70. Added Outbound Summary Interval Report which will show various statistics
	for a range of campaigns, filtering results by call time and displaying
	them broken down by 15/30/60 minute periods by campaign. Also has an 
	option to included the drop overflow calls in the statistics.

71. Added option for links to the reports page by including a file in vicidial
	web directory named 'custom_report_links.html'. This allows you to 
	maintain custom links even after upgrading your system. There is a
	'EXAMPLEcustom_report_links.html' file included in that directory that
	can just be copied and customized for your needs.

72. Replaced all "SELECT *" MySQL queries with proper field lists. This makes
	database table field order less important, allowing for more 
	customizations by the user without causing problems.

73. Added an API function(change_ingroups) which allows the selected in-groups
	for an agent to be changed while they are active in the ViciDial Agent
	screen. Once changed in this way, the agent would need to log out and 
	back in to be able to select in-groups themselves. Blended can also be
	changed using this function. For more information see the AGENT_API.txt
	document in the docs directory.

74. Added a non-agent-API function and a new feature to the Real-Time screen
	that allows a manager to change the in-groups selected by an agent in
	real time while an agent is logged in. Simply click on the INFO + link

	and select if you want to override the agent default settings then 
	click submit. Manager must have the ability to Change Agent Campaign in
	their user settings.

	either or both of these the script content will load twice if you have
	auto-launch set to SCRIPT. Only works with recording set to ALLCALLS or
	ALLFORCE for script on auto-launch. Also, added a refresh link for the
	script tab to reload content at will.

76. Redesigned the Transfer-Conference frame in the agent interface and added
	a CONSULTATIVE checkbox to allow for easier consultative 3-way calls
	with other ViciDial agents with customer information. This also allows
	for AGENTDIRECT consultative transfers. CXFER is no longer needed to do
	consultative transfers

77. Added "Delete Voicemail After Email" options to delete messages on the
	server after they have been emailed

78. Added CRM Login Popup to campaign settings to allow for a custom window to
	be opened on agent login, optionally using agent and campaign variables

	ID number that will be populated in the vendor ID(vendor_lead_code) 
	field.

83. Added an agent API function to update vicidial_list fields and the field
	values in the agent screen on-the-fly for the agent's current call

84. Added timer action options to campaigns and in-groups allowing a message,
	webform or D1/D2-dial to happen at a specified number of seconds after
	the customer connects to the agent. Also, an API callw as added for this

85. Added three more transfer-conference number-to-dial presets as well as List
	ID override options for all five number presets

86. Added Dispo Call URL that allows a back-end call to a web page or URL, that
	will not display to the agent, which can send information like the 
	selected disposition, talk time, phone number or most of the other 
	fields available in the web form into a formatted URL to post to a 
	remote web server. Available in Campaigns and In-Groups.

87. Added log rolling archive script to automatically move logs into archive 
	tables monthly. The ADMIN_archive_log_tables.pl script needs to be added
	to your crontab to run monthly(example: "30 1 1 * *")

88. Added Traditional Chinese (zt_tw) language translation of the agent screen
	which can be found in the LANG_www/agc_tw directory





########## UPGRADING FROM 2.0.4 TO 2.0.5 ##########

1. Note the license change from GPLv2 to AGPLv2. This change was made to close
	the ASP loophole for code distribution that was present in the GPLv2 
	license. Please read the docs/LICENSE.txt file for more information

2. install new files:
	perl ./install.pl
	NOTES: If you have customized any scripts in the bin or agi folders, 
	then make sure you back them up before running the install.pl script. 
	This script will replace existing files in the astguiclient installation.

3. upgrade the MySQL asterisk database:
	mysql
	use asterisk
	\. /path/from/root/extras/upgrade_2.0.5.sql
	quit

4. Several of the MySQL tables have been changed to a HEAP type to reside in
	memory to improve performance.

5. Added the ability for inbound and blended agents to choose their selected
	in-groups without logging out. The new GROUPS link at the top of the 
	agent screen(vicidial.php) can be used when an agent is Paused to
	change their selected groups and whether they are set to do Blended
	calling or not. There is also a new log with the details of what
	groups an agent has selected each time in the user stats page.

6. Queue Priority has been added allowing for the prioritization of one in-group
	over another in-group or outbound campaign(when in blended mode)

7. Drop call action has been added to both inbound and outbound calling. You
	can now send a call that would drop into an inbound group. The call will
	still be recorded as a DROP in it's original in-group or campaign, but 
	the lead information will move on to the drop in-group.

8. Audio recording mixing/compression/ftping scripts have been completely
	rewritten and separated into different scripts for better fault
	tolerance. Also, you have the option of compression in to the following
	formats: WAV, GSM, MP3 and OGG
	- AST_CRON_audio_1_move_mix.pl
	- AST_CRON_audio_1_move_VDonly.pl
	- AST_CRON_audio_2_compress.pl
	- AST_CRON_audio_3_ftp.pl

12. The start of a new QC (Quality Control) feature [non functional right now]

13. Install the Switch perl module from CPAN
	perl -MCPAN -e shell
	- install Switch

14. Recording to RAM now uses tmpfs it is usually included in all kernels if you want 
	to check in in menuconfig you will find it under
	File Systems --> Pseudo filesystems --> [*] Virtual memory file system support.
	It does not hurt to enable 
	[*] Tmpfs POSIX Access Control Lists  
	as well.
	The following line should be added to /etc/fstab:
	tmpfs                /var/spool/asterisk/monitor  tmpfs  rw                    0 0
	Mounting the ramdisk in rc.local should be remove:
	# mke2fs -m 0 /dev/ram0
	# mount /dev/ram0 /var/spool/asterisk/monitor
	This allows for a more efficient use of memory and recording to RAM with less RAM 
	available.

15. The following should be added to the [featuremap] section of /etc/asterisk/features.conf
	to prevent agents and called parties from being able to "transfer" a call to any 
	number possible in your Asterisk dialplan.
	[featuremap]
	blindxfer => D

	monitoring possible for all agents no matter their phone type 0860XXXX.

17. Added the ability to load balance the logins to vicidial.php for phones 
	that are registered to multiple servers on a multi-server system. 
	Simply put multiple phone_login values in the phone login field at 
	login separated by a comma and the vicidial.php script will pick the 
	server that has the fewest agents logged into it at the moment of login.

18. Added ability for vicidial.php to populate the phones.computer_ip field upon
	agent login. Options set in the vicidial.php file to allow for overwrite
	every login or only if field is empty.

	the last time a lead was called as well as for lead recycling changes.

32. IMPORTANT FOR RECORDINGS!!!
   The recording extensions have been changed within VICIDIAL so you need to
   add the following lines to your extensions.conf

33. Added option (for Internet Explorer users only) to copy a field to the
   clipboard of the agent computer upon a call being sent to the agent.

34. Added new alternate number dialing method which allows for over 65,000 alt
   phone numbers per lead. Currently these extra numbers are only available for 
   auto dialing, not manual dial. These extra alternate number leads must be 
   imported either with the CLI lead loader(VICIDIAL_IN_new_leads_file.pl) or
   the non-agent API script.

35. Added campaign-specific DNC filtering lists to the system

36. Added optional dialplan entries to sample extensions.conf to play a not-in-

   extensions.conf dialplan. 
   *requires initial adding one line to dialplan of inbound context:
      exten => _X.,1,AGI(agi-DID_route.agi)
   *as well as a few more lines in your VICIDIAL default context:
      ; DID forwarded calls

   more accurate time zone encoding. The data is NOT included but can be 
   purchased from the VICIDIAL Group.

54. Added System Settings option to disable auto-dialing(list dialing) from the
   system to simplify administration for inbound-only call centers

55. Added patch and configuration options to allow VICIDIAL to work with Sangoma
   ParaXip CPD(Call Progress Detection) for Answering Maching and Fax detection

56. Added list_download.php that allows you to download the entire contents of
   vicidial lists from the admin.php interface. You must set the download_lists
   permission in vicidial_users to 1 for this to work.

57. Small redesign of the agent interface to use grey backgrounds and new tabs

58. Added Asterisk version prompt to the install.pl script to allow for the
   copying of the proper conf files for the installed Asterisk version

59. Added auto-generation of SIP and IAX phones and carriers into the Asterisk 
   conf files so that you can fully configure them using only the admin.php
   web interface. See the ASTERISK_CONF-GEN.txt file for more information

60. Added group alias option for selecting callerID on manual and 3rd-party
   calls

61. Added options for custom web variables for each agent per in-group and
   camaign. This is definable in the user modification page

62. Added Agent Shift enforcement options to restrict logins and vicidial 
   agent activity 

63. Added Server vital statistics(load/CPU/disk) to the reports screen and the
   server modification screen

64. Removed the admin_changes flat text log file and now put all administrative 
   actions into the vicidial_admin_log table in MySQL. These logs are displayed
   to user_level 9 users in admin.php through a link on the REPORTS screen, and 
   at the bottom of the other screens (USERS, CAMPAIGNS, LISTS, etc...)you can 
   click on the "Click here to see Admin chages to this record" link to find out
   the most recent changes to that record.

65. Added uniform admin headers to all administrative pages and reports

66. Added Calls Export Utility allowing exporting of call and lead data by 
   defining the following parameters: date range, campaigns, in-groups, statuses,
   lists and user groups. A flat tab-delimited text file is exported.

67. Added new monitoring functionality to allow monitoring from one agent to
   another without hanging up

68. Added Russian version of the Agent screen

69. Added Dutch version of the Agent screen

70. Many changes have been made to the extensions.conf dialplan. It is usually
   better to take the default docs/conf_examples/extensions.conf.sample file and
   take the customizations from your old extensions.conf file and move them into
   the new file.





########## UPGRADING FROM 2.0.3 TO 2.0.4 ##########

1. install new files:
	perl ./install.pl
	NOTES: If you have customized any scripts in the bin or agi folders, 
	then make sure you back them up before running the install.pl script. 
	This script will replace existing files in the astguiclient installation.

2. upgrade the MySQL asterisk database:
	mysql
	use asterisk
	\. /path/from/root/extras/upgrade_2.0.4.sql
	quit
	NOTE: If you do not use the standard "cron" database login, you will
	need to add "LOCK TABLES" to the permissions to your db login

3. add the "server_reports" directory to your Web Path:
	mkdir $PATHweb/vicidial/server_reports/
	chmod 0777 $PATHweb/vicidial/server_reports/

4. A new set of changes have been made to the statuses sections in the admin.php
	pages allowing for categorizing statues and modifying them without delete.
	Also, the gathering of a tally of the statuses in these categories is 
	now available on the timeonVDADall scripts.

5. The admin.php interface has had more sections broken into sub-sections for
	easier management and rapid modifications.

6. Added option for shorter enter and leave sounds(done during Asterisk build)
	BASE/SCRATCH_INSTALL or extras/Changed_meetme_sounds for more details

7. Added optional patch to meetme in Asterisk 1.2.X that will allow for better 
	DTMF passthru. Need to use the "F" flag to enable on Meetme in 
	extensiosn.conf. Feature is backported from Asterisk 1.4.X

8. REQUIRED! Changed the FastAGI_log process to consolidate the "h" exten hangup 
	process into one executed function instead of two. Because of this, the 
	h exten needs to be changed to only the following:
	exten => h,1,DeadAGI(agi://127.0.0.1:4577/call_log--HVcauses--PRI-----NODEBUG-----${HANGUPCAUSE}-----${DIALSTATUS}-----${DIALEDTIME}-----${ANSWEREDTIME}))

9. Moved the audio transfer script and report generating scripts settings to 
	/etc/astguiclient.conf settings file. FTP and reports login info.

10. Added agent alert, music-on-hold and several other parameters to inbound 
	groups. Make sure you have musiconhold working properly before using 
	in production.

11. REQUIRED CHANGE! in your dialplan you must now add lines for load balancing
	even if you only have one server, and you must also have lines with the
	7 prefix for silent insertion into the meetme conference:
		exten => _010*010*010*015*8600XXX,...
		exten => _010*010*010*015*8600XXX*.,...
		exten => _010*010*010*015*78600XXX,...
		exten => _010*010*010*015*78600XXX*.,...
		exten => _78600XXX*.,1,AGI(agi-VDADfixCXFER.agi)
	See LOAD_BALANCING.txt and extensions.conf.sample for more information

12. Inbound, Blended and Closer-type campaigns are no longer required to have
	campaign_id incude specific words or characters to be treated as such.
	There is now a new campaign_allow_inbound field where this is set.

13. Call distribution by agent ranking per in-group and total calls to in-group

14. Added ability to copy the settings campaigns, users and in-groups to new records

15. REQUIRED CHANGE! Old inbound and Closer AGI scripts have all been consolidated
	into a single script: agi-VDAD_ALL_inbound.agi
	Please look at the script header or the SCRATCH_INSTALL doc for more
	info on how to alter your extenions.conf to use the new script.
	The old agi-VDAD_closer... scripts have all been depricated and moved
	to the extras/old_agi/ directory.

16. AST_agent_performance_detail.php report script has been completely rewritten

17. REQUIRED CHANGE! If you use Fronter/Closer campaigns where an agent is sending
	calls to a closer, you will need to define the new "Default Transfer Group"
	field with the inbound group that you want to take the calls. Transfers
	are now allowed from a list of definable in-groups that you have to set
	in the campaign detail screen.

18. In the vicidial.php code, you can now modify the size of the elements on the
	screen using the BROWSER_HEIGHT and BROWSER_WIDTH variables.





########## UPGRADING FROM 2.0.2 TO 2.0.3 ##########

1. install new files:
	perl ./install.pl
	NOTES: If you have customized any scripts in the bin or agi folders, 
	then make sure you back them up before running the install.pl script. 
	This script will replace existing files in the astguiclient installation.

2. upgrade the MySQL asterisk database:
	mysql
	use asterisk
	\. /path/from/root/extras/upgrade_2.0.3.sql
	quit

3. The server_stats.php has been merged into the vicidial/admin.php page

4. Width of the admin.php screen, and the color and size of the headers are all
	now definable by variables at top of the admin.php script.

5. Dial Override checkbox added to the campaign modification screen of admin.php
	to force manual dial_level changes in ADAPT dialing modes.

6. Behaviour of HotKeys in manual dial mode has changed to automatically go on 
	to the next lead when a HotKey is pressed.

7. It is now possible for agents to dial alternate phone numbers using only
	HotKeys if ALTPH2 and/or ADDR3 are added to a campaign's hotkeys.

8. You can now use BLEND/INBND/*_C/*_B/*_I to define a campaign a a CLOSER 
	campaign capable of taking inbound calls.

9. In Auto-dialing campaigns(RATIO and ADAPT) you can now configure the dialer 
	to dial up to two alternate numbers per lead automatically, as well as 
	defining the statuses that you want to do this for. More info about
	this feature in the ALTERNATE_NUMBER_DIALING.txt doc.

10. Added ability to send multiple concurrent transfers at once to agents in 
	outbound campaigns. This will greatly benefit larger VICIDIAL 
	installations by decreasing the time it takes for a call to get	to an 
	agent once answered after a large queue backup. This is defaulted to 
	AUTO, but can be forced to a set number. This is the Concurrent 
	Transfers option in the Campaign Modification page.

11. New optimized code for AST_manager_send.pl and AST_send_action_child.pl. 
	Thanks to Lott Caskey for the code contribution

12. The field user_group has been added to several log tables to allow for 
	better tracking of stats by user groups. Several reports now offer 
	user group display options.

13. VERY IMPORTANT!!! Make sure the php.ini setting for memory_limit is set to 
	a minimum of 12M, we recommend 48M:
		memory_limit = 48M
	Some of the scripts have grown in size and need more memory to run
	properly on some systems.

14. Added ability to control access to each admin section by vicidial_users.
	This includes a view_reports settings to restrict access to all of the
	reports scripts.

15. Added Agent Pause Codes that are definable per campaign and allows the
	agent to select what they are doing when they are in pause time.

16. Added optional Asterisk-compatible queue_log logging for QueueMetrics
	compatibility. See the QUEUEMETRICS.txt doc for more information

17. RECOMMENDATION - If you are calling in the USA, you should add the 
	"--postal-code-gmt" flag to your adjust GMT script in the crontab to
	more accurately assign timezones to your leads.

18. Changed dial statuses to use dynamic number of dial statuses instead of
	static dial_status_x fields.

19. Added Mute/UnMute ability to vicidial.php agent screen. To use, you must
	have the _X18600XXX and _X28600XXX entries in your extensions.conf

20. Added basic sipsak display on compatible SIP devices for VICIDIAL activity.

21. Tested with Asterisk 1.2.16 and 1.2.17, new patch for meetme volume controls
	for those two versions, see SCRATCH_INSTALL for more info.

22. Added HOME link to the admin web page that goes to a configurable web address.






########## UPGRADING FROM 2.0.1 TO 2.0.2 ##########

1. install new files:
	perl ./install.pl
	NOTES: If you have customized any scripts in the bin or agi folders, 
	then make sure you back them up before running the install.pl script. 
	This script will replace existing files in the astguiclient installation.

	/etc/astguiclient.conf has new variables for new functionality including:
	- new ADMIN_keepalive_ALL process settings
	- FastAGI_log server settings
	and comments are added to the astguiclient.conf file

2. upgrade the MySQL asterisk database:
	mysql
	use asterisk
	\. /path/from/root/extras/upgrade_2.0.2.sql
	quit
	/usr/share/astguiclient/ADMIN_area_code_populate.pl
		The Daylight Savings Time scheme for the USA and Canada has been
		updated for the 2007 changes. Also, Brazil DST has been added.
		Another addition on this topic is the addition of USA zipcode
		GMT offset list that allows for more accurate timezone lookups.

3. The astguiclient web directory has been removed and the 
	astguiclient/admin.php functions have been merged into the 
	vicidial/admin.php page

4. You can now define trunks for use only by specific campaigns. See the help
	in the vicidial/admin.php server modification page under the 
	VICIDIAL SERVER TRUNKS section.

5. Agents now have the ability to control volume levels for any call in their 
	meetme room directly from the vicidial.php page. This only works on 
	Asterisk 1.2.7.1, 1.2.12.1, 1.2.13 or SVN_1.2 and the meetmeadmin_volume_control.patch
	patch must be applied as described in the SCRATCH_INSTALL. Also, a few 
	lines must be added to the extensions.conf for this to work:
	(_X48600XXX, _X38600XXX, 8300 [see docs/conf_examples/extensions.conf.sample])

6. Multiple ADMIN_keepalive scripts have been replaced with a single script
	ADMIN_keepalive_ALL.pl
	Remove all other ADMIN keepalive entries in your crontab and replace
	with this one:
	### keepalive script for astguiclient processes
	* * * * * /usr/share/astguiclient/ADMIN_keepalive_ALL.pl

	NOTE: the scripts to be kept alive are to be defined in the astguiclient.conf file

7. FastAGI replacement for call_log and VD_hangup AGI scripts:
	FastAGI_log.pl - requires cpan module Net::Server to run
	If you want to use it, read the comments at the top of the script
	Look at the docs/conf_examples/extensions.conf.sample file for examples
	of how to use this new feature in your dialplan
	- cpan
	- install Net::Server

8. Fix for unregistered SIP trunks (thanks to Chris Doyle):
	look at the bottom of the docs/conf_examples/extensions.conf.sample
	file for examples of what to put in your extensions.conf file to get
	VICIDIAL auto dialing to work with non-registered SIP trunks. remember 
	to put sip-silence.gsm in your /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/ directory.

9. Added new campaign summary screen and reformatted the timeonVDADall report:
	A summary screen with all of the call information for every active 
	campaign for the day. reformatted campaign Realtime report with new
	colors and other display options.

10. Added new script to change the server_ip entries when a machine changes IPs
	The ADMIN_update_server_ip.pl script can be used to update your server's
	IP address within all vicidial database tables and config files from
	this one script. This can even be run in the crontab if you are on
	a DHCP service and need to modify your IP address often

11. Added new script to allow for dial-out-only(no agents on the server) 
	VICIDIAL servers as well as balance dialing where a server with 
	available trunk lines can dial lines for another server that does not
	have enough lines to dial for it's dial_level. AST_VDauto_dial_FILL.pl
	script is only for multi-server systems and is started from new 
	ADMIN_keepalive_ALL.pl script with option 7 in astguiclient.conf

12. Added the ability to restrict agent logins by user group to a specific set
	of campaigns. This is definable in the USER GROUPS section of admin.php.
	You must make sure that your admin login is in a user group and that
	the selected user group has the allowable campaigns set to ALL
	CAMPAIGNS to be able to view and modify all campaigns in the system.

13. Added lead_id and user fields to the recording_log, along with cross-
	reference links in several admin web pages for these.

14. Changed Drop percentage to be out of Answered calls for FTC compliance.

15. Tested new asterisk-perl module (0.09) and found that it is NOT compatible.
	Please make sure you use asterisk-perl-0.08 ONLY.





########## UPGRADING FROM 1.1.12-3 TO 2.0.1 ##########

If you are upgrading to the 2.0 code tree from the 1.1.12-3 release there have 
been several changes made to the code base and to where some files are stored in
the release as well as on your machine.

1. upgrade the MySQL Asterisk database:
	mysql
	use asterisk
	\. /path/from/root/extras/upgrade_2.0.1.sql
	quit


2. use the new installer for astguiclient-VICIDIAL files:
	NOTE: this new script is interactive with prompts. this script will
	create the new /etc/astguiclient.conf settings file that replaces the
	old AST_SERVER_conf.pl file that has been removed. Also, this settings
	file is used by dbconnect.php scripts so no need to manually edit them

	perl install.pl


3. Make sure you have MySQL clientlibs installed:
Because all perl script now use DBI instead of Net::MySQL you need to make sure 
that you have at least the MySQL client installed on all VICIDIAL servers even 
if the MySQL server is installed on another machine. You can skip this step if 
MySQL server is already on your VICIDIAL server:
  Go to http://www.mysql.com/ and download the mysql package
   - to install this directly on the command line type:
	- cd /usr/local
	- wget http://mirror.trouble-free.net/mysql_mirror/Downloads/MySQL-4.0/mysql-4.0.27.tar.gz
	- gunzip mysql-4.0.27.tar.gz
	- tar xvf mysql-4.0.27.tar
	- cd mysql-4.0.27
	- groupadd mysql
	- useradd -g mysql mysql
	- "./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --without-server --enable-shared=yes --with-readline"
	- make
	- make install
   - you are done


4. New MySQL perl modules:
You will need to make sure that you have installed the following perl modules:
DBI (top-level Database interface module "install DBI")
DBD::mysql (MySQL-specific interface through DBI "force install DBD::mysql")


5. new predictive dialing crontab entry:
If you will be using the new predictive dialing functions you need to make sure 
you have the keepalive for this function loaded in your crontab:
NOTE: this only needs to be on a single server if you are in a multiple 
VICIDIAL server setup.
### keepalive script for VICIDIAL predictive script
* * * * * /usr/share/astguiclient/ADMIN_keepalive_AST_VDadapt.pl


6. all old crontab entries and /home/cron files 
All of your old crontab entries need to be changed from /home/cron to
/usr/share/astguiclient if you choose the default installation path. You can
manually set the path to /home/cron if you like though since the home path is
now dynamic in all vicidial perl(.pl) scripts. If you do choose to use the new
default path, you can delete everything in the /home/cron directory if you like


7. old /etc/rc.d/rc.local entries
Be sure to change your /etc/rc.d/rc.local entries(the commands that are run at
system boot to start asterisk and other scripts like log rolling) and change the
/home/cron path to the new /usr/share/astguiclient path.


8. other notes:
- there is a new DIAL METHOD field and several other new dial-control fields 
in campaign modification page, please take a minute to read the help 
documentation for these new features.
