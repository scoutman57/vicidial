################ UPGRADE

If you are upgrading to the 2.0 code tree from the 1.1.12-3 release there have 
been several changes made to the code base and to where some files are stored in
the release as well as on your machine.

1. upgrade the MySQL Asterisk database:
mysql
use asterisk
\. /path/from/root/extras/upgrade_2.0.1.sql
quit


2. use the new installer for astguiclient-VICIDIAL files:
	NOTE: this new script is interactive with prompts. this script will
	create the new /etc/astguiclient.conf settings file that replaces the
	old AST_SERVER_conf.pl file that has been removed. Also, this settings
	file is used by dbconnect.php scripts so no need to manually edit them

perl install.pl


3. Make sure you have MySQL clientlibs installed:
Because all perl script now use DBI instead of Net::MySQL you need to make sure 
that you have at least the MySQL client installed on all VICIDIAL servers even 
if the MySQL server is installed on another machine. You can skip this step if 
MySQL server is already on your VICIDIAL server:
  Go to http://www.mysql.com/ and download the mysql package
   - to install this directly on the command line type:
	- cd /usr/local
	- wget http://mirror.trouble-free.net/mysql_mirror/Downloads/MySQL-4.0/mysql-4.0.27.tar.gz
	- gunzip mysql-4.0.27.tar.gz
	- tar xvf mysql-4.0.27.tar
	- cd mysql-4.0.27
	- groupadd mysql
	- useradd -g mysql mysql
	- "./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --without-server --enable-shared=yes --with-readline"
	- make
	- make install
   - you are done


4. New MySQL perl modules:
You will need to make sure that you have installed the following perl modules:
DBI (top-level Database interface module "install DBI")
DBD::mysql (MySQL-specific interface through DBI "force install DBD::mysql")


5. new predictive dialing crontab entry:
If you will be using the new predictive dialing functions you need to make sure 
you have the keepalive for this function loaded in your crontab:
NOTE: this only needs to be on a single server if you are in a multiple 
VICIDIAL server setup.
### keepalive script for VICIDIAL predictive script
* * * * * /usr/share/astguiclient/ADMIN_keepalive_AST_VDadapt.pl


6. all old crontab entries and /home/cron files 
All of your old crontab entries need to be changed from /home/cron to
/usr/share/astguiclient if you choose the default installation path. You can
manually set the path to /home/cron if you like though since the home path is
now dynamic in all vicidial perl(.pl) scripts. If you do choose to use the new
default path, you can delete everything in the /home/cron directory if you like


7. old /etc/rc.d/rc.local entries
Be sure to change your /etc/rc.d/rc.local entries(the commands that are run at
system boot to start asterisk and other scripts like log rolling) and change the
/home/cron path to the new /usr/share/astguiclient path.


8. other notes:
- there is a new DIAL METHOD field and several other new dial-control fields 
in campaign modification page, please take a minute to read the help 
documentation for these new features.
