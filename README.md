# This is my README
I took the liberty to download every 
Asterisk GUI client, VICIdial version from SourceForge and place each version in it's own branch.

I plan on placing each version in master to perserve the build history for changes from version to version. This will allow to see code diffs from each version branch.

The original project is by:
Matt Florell (mflorell) 
https://sourceforge.net/u/mflorell/profile/

Matt does not use a version control system for distrubution. Please feel free to reach out to him and keep requestion that VIcIDial be made available via git. This would be a much better process for end users than using sourceforge.

The original project can be located at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/astguiclient/
